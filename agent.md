Carreer-path for hospital,
- we have an angular app, front end only
- we use modern techniques
- we use tailwind for css
- we integrated cytoscape to display a interactiver graphic
- the data is read from assets/data/careerpaths.json for paths
- data is read from assets/data/careernodes.json for nodes



My goal for today is; i need to people in my organisation to deliver data for me. But they are tech savy. The json files as mentioned above should be filled with data. How can we best approach this?
My thoughts are; creating a excel file (or better an csv) that they can fill. which I can then export to the json files as they are now. Could you help in this apporach?
